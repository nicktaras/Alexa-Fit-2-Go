// JOKES (MATH RANDOM - 30 mins to implement)

// Was in the gym earlier and decided to jump on the treadmill.

// TIPS: (MATH RANDOM - 30 mins to implement)

// SOURCE: https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ten-tips/10-tips-to-exercise-safely

// Be aware of your body. Think about how the particular exercise is making you feel. If something doesnâ€™t feel right, stop immediately and seek medical advice.
// Warm up and cool down. Try slow stretches and go through the motions of your sport or activity before starting. Cool down with slow stretching.
// Pace yourself. Have at least one recovery day each week to rest. If you are experiencing pain, rest until the pain has gone.
// Mix it up. Try other sports and exercises to reduce the risk of overtraining.
// Strap or tape. If a joint is prone to injury, consider strapping or taping it before exercising. Even better, see an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to obtain a program to strengthen the injured area and get advice on proper taping techniques.
// Stay hydrated. You can lose around one and a half litres of fluid for every hour of exercise; so drink water before, during and after a session.
// Be weather aware. Take it easier in hot weather and wear clothing and sunscreen to protect yourself from the elements.
// Do it right. Try to get the technique right from the beginning, to ensure you are using your muscles correctly.
// Check your gear. Make sure your shoes and equipment fit properly and are right for the activity. Look after your equipment and check it regularly for safety.
// Be sensible, especially at night or in secluded areas. Take a friend or your dog, stick to well-lit areas and wear bright or light-reflective clothing so drivers can see you.

// So you've worked out on the weekend, and you want to keep up the momentum around office hours.
// How about trying some of the following ideas:
// Get off one bus, train, tram stop earlier and walk
// Park car further away from work and walk
// Consider cycling to work
// Walk more briskly on your commute or in between meetings
// Walking meetings
// Choose a bathroom further away
// Make sure you take a break from your screen over lunch
// Take the stairs and not the elevator

// Exercise doesnt have to be scoring the goal, or hitting the wickets. 
// What about trying out some of these types of exercise instead; Gardening, washing the car or House work.
// It's a win win - exercise and a chore knocked off the list.

// get Facebook User data available to application.
